# Cruise ship.
___
## Description.
This was my second JavaScript project, which I created a GUI for using HTML and CSS. It was tested using Jest, the tests can be found in the \_\_tests__ folder. 

Ports are created which the ship can sail from and dock. I love the retro feel of it but I would like the user to have more interaction. Perhaps being able to name the ship and have more than one ship.

## How to use:
To start you need to enter a port name into the form and click add. You can add as many ports as you like but there is a minimum of 2 and they must have a name (they can't be blank). The port names will appear in the itinerary as they are added. Once you have all the ports you want click done and the ports and ship will appear.

To sail to the first port click the "set sail!" button at the bottom of the viewport. The ship will sail and messages will appear informing you which port they have left and at which port they arrive. Once they have arrived at the first port you can then sail to the next one. A message will display when you have reached the final port. If you want to reset at any point simply click the reset button.
